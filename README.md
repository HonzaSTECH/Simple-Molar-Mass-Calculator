# Simple Molar Mass Calculator
Simple Molar Mass Calculator is a very simple Windows Forms app programmed in C#. Its purpose is simple - you type a chemical formula of any chemical substance, hit Enter and the application will instantly tell you its molar mass (with two decimal numbers precision). The application is extremely easy to use and it comes with a small guide in its Help menu.

## Installation
Installing Simple Molar Mass Calculator is very easy. You will probably want lastest stable release. To get it, click on the `X releases` label in the lower navigation panel (next to the number of commits, branches, contributors...) or go to [this](https://github.com/HonzaSTECH/Simple-Molar-Mass-Calculator/releases) address. Then, just choose the lastest release and download the `.exe` file.

After downloading, you can just copy the `.exe` file to your desktop or wherever you want to open it whenever you want. There is no installer - you are downloading the built version of the application.

I recommend using the latest release. It will always have the newest features and bug fixes. Bug reports on older versions won't be fixed in the same version. You will always need the newest version to avoid discovered bugs.

## Use
Here is a simple example. Imagine, you need to quickly calculate molar mass of water
1. You open the application
2. You type the formula (H2O)
3. You hit `Enter` or press the `Calculate` button
4. You get your result. You can copy it by right-clicking the output box.
5. That's it. I promised it will be simple.
