# Contributing to the project
Hi there!

If you are reading this, then you are most probably willing to contribute to this project. First of all, this is great! I am just learning with *Windows Forms* and there are probably thousands of things I could do better, so don't hesitate to fix them. It will help me to learn and I will give you some credit too!

Any form of contribution is appreciated. Submitting bug reports or feature requests with issues, reviewing pull requests or even writing and pushing code.

To keep it short, here is how I would like you to contribute if you are wanting to write code.
1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Make your changes on your fork
3. Submit a pull request to merge your branch into my master

In your pull request, please specify, what exactly you did. It will greatly help me to learn and to review your changes.

If you are going to submit an issue, please, pick one of the provided templates (if possible) and try to fill as many fields as possible. It will greatly help me to understand what you mean.

Once again, thanks for reading this document. I am really looking forward to your submissions!
